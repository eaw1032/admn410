	<h1>Our History</h1>
	<p>The Durham House of Pets (DHP) was founded in July of 2015 by a University of New Hampshire graduate, Jane Doe, who wanted to use her recently earned degree in Business Administration and her love for animals to open a business to benefit the overall community and the Durham area. The business started off very small, as only custom designed dog leashes were sold at first. Since then, the Durham House of Pets has expanded immensely and we now sell food for dogs, cats and fish, as well as the necessary supplies that are required in order to properly care for these three types of animals.
	</p>
	<h2>Why use us?</h2>
	<p>Here at the Durham House of Pets, we consider ourselves to be unique amongst our competitors for a variety of reasons. Not only is the founder of our business a local college graduate with expertise in business, but our employees are college students, who are also looking for some insight on how to run a business. Aside from their skills, we also have some of the most friedly employees, who are always willing to go the extra mile for you. Do you need recommendations on which type of food is best for the specific breed of your dog? Our employees will know the answer, and they will deliver it with a smile. In addition, all of our food products for dogs, cats, and fish have been certified by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), in order to ensure only the highest quality of food for your animals. We also believe that our location on Main Street in Durham, NH sets us above many of our nearby competitors, as we are centrally located in the town of Durham, and we are easily accessible to residents within Durham, as well as residents from surrounding areas.
